QUESTIONS TO WORK THROUGH
================================================
? Define Address as an array with elements:
    :street
    :city
    :state
    :zipcode
    :neighborhood

    Then give market.area and target.location an address value as submitted by the user? So Address doesn't ever actually save anything - just passes its structure and supplied values to the correct model fields?

    So market.area & target.location = [
      street="street_string",
      city="city_string",
      state="state_string",
      zipcode="zipcode_string",
      neighborhood="neighborhood_string"
      longitude=long_float
      latitude=lat_float
    ]

    Required values:
      city+state OR zipcode

    Have longitude and latitude values returned by running geocoder process?

    >> Look up how to set parameter requirements as an either-or.
    >> Need to find a geocoder gem.


? Use inclusion in models
