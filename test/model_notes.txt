QUESTIONS TO WORK THROUGH
================================================
? Define Address as an array with elements:
    :street
    :city
    :state
    :zipcode
    :neighborhood

  Then give market.area and target.location an address value as submitted by the user? So Address doesn't ever actually save anything - just passes its structure and supplied values to the correct model fields?

  So market.area & target.location = [
    street="street_string",
    city="city_string",
    state="state_string",
    zipcode="zipcode_string",
    neighborhood="neighborhood_string"
    longitude=long_float
    latitude=lat_float
  ]

  Required values:
    city+state OR zipcode

  Longitude and Latitude values returned by running geocoder process.
