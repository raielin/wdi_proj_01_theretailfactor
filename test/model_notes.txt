QUESTIONS TO WORK THROUGH
================================================
? Define Address as an array with elements:
    :street
    :city
    :state
    :zipcode
    :neighborhood

  Then give market.area and target.location an address value as submitted by the user? So Address doesn't ever actually save anything - just passes its structure and supplied values to the correct model fields?
